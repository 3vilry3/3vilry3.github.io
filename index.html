### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was avery fun lab because I was able to actaully code something and 
    have the computer do something for the first time! The work for making the 
    computer say "hello world" was not very intense, but the fact it actually 
    did some thing was amazing. After all the confusing set up of linux and 
    unbuntu this Lab made me very happy.

* Lab 5 part 1

    Lab 5, part 1 was very challenging for me, but it was a unforgetable 
    expirience getting a good grade on it! This was the first lab where I did 
    not have a partner who knew what they were doing, so my partner and I had 
    to push forward without the support of a classmate who knows how to program. 
    The creation of the Madlib for this lab was hard fought and one I will remember 
    when I dont have to take the lead in the future. 

* Lab 8 part 2

    Lab 8, part 2 was a tricky lab where we had to figure out how to get a computer
    to tell when a number is prime. I had a blast on this lab and my partner, karina,
    was super funny. This lab was hard but definatly the highlight of this class
    because of how fun it was to code and work our way through.
